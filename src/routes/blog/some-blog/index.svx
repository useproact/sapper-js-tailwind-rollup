# Introduction

Well, I've been wanting to make my own homepage or newtab page. I thought this kind of thing is only possible in firefox. You might have seen some cool custom firefox startpage like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/comments/hfuoqg/a_simple_startpage_i_have_been_working_on). Turns out, if you want a custom newtab page on chrome, you have to make an extension for that. Fortunately, it is super simple.

# Making the extension

## Prerequisite

Before we start, we must prepare several things.

-   Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS (JS isn't required though, it's optional).
-   Text editor
-   Chrome based browser (duh? obviously)

## Preparing the project

First thing first, make a directory with the name of your choice anywhere you prefer. I'll have mine at `~/codes/chrome-page`. Then inside that directory, create a `manifest.json` file. Fill it with this.

```json
{
    "name": "Startpage",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "My personal custom startpage",
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "chrome_url_overrides": {
        "newtab": "index.html"
    }
}
```

If you want to know this file even more, [google has it covered](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest) for you. The important part here is the `chrome_url_overrides.newtab` field. You should point that to an HTML file that you want to make as a startpage.

## Making the page

Honestly, nothing much to tell here. You can go as overkill as you want for a startpage or just go ahead and pick one from the internet. I suggest you to go to [r/startpage](https://reddit.com/r/startpage) subreddit for a start. Here's mine.

It's super simple, I just set some vim-like shortcut (prefixed with colon) like `:o` to open a new website, `:s` to do google search, `:gh` to open github, etc. If you want mine, you can get it [here](https://github.com/elianiva/dotfiles/blob/master/misc/codes/chrome-page).

<Update date="17-10-2020">

I made a new once since the old one is too minimal. Here's the new one.

<Update date="26-02-2021">

I simplified my previous startpage by removing the icons and changing the font and the background. I also added a random sentence at the top so I will always memorise a word everytime I open a newtab page. There's also a link to [jisho.org](https://jisho.org) in case I got interested on that word.

You can get this new one [here](https://github.com/elianiva/dotfiles/blob/master/codes/startpage) and I have an API that serves random word [here](https://github.com/elianiva/random-jp-api).

## Applying the homepage

To apply the homepage that you've made, go ahead to `chrome://extensions` and activate **Developer Mode** at the top right corner. A new menu should appeared. Click on the button that says **Load Unpacked**. A file manager will appear, go ahead and navigate to your project directory and click **OK** or **Choose** or whatever your file manager gives you. New extension should appear with the name that you choose earlier on `manifest.json`. Activate it and that's it, your custom startpage should appear whenever you open a new tab.

# Conclusion

Making a custom startpage for google chrome isn't that hard. I thought it requires some weird trick or something but it's not. Hope you find this post useful and see ya later, have a nice day! ãƒ„
